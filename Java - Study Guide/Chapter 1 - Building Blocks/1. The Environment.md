## Major Components of Java

The ***Java Development Kit*** (**JDK**) contains the minimum software you need to do Java development. Key commands include the following:
- ***javac***: Converts `.java` source files into `.class` bytecode
- ***java***: Executes the program
- ***jar***: Packages files together
- ***javadoc***: Generates documentation

>**Where Did *JRE* go?**
> 
>In **Java 8** and earlier, you could download a Java Runtime Environment (**JRE**) instead of the 
>full **JDK**. The **JRE** was a subset of the **JDK** that was used for running a program but could 
>not compile one. Now, people can use the full **JDK** when running a Java program. Alternatively, developers can supply an executable that contains the required pieces that would have been in the  **JRE**.
