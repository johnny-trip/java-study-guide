All java objects are stored in your program memory's ***heap***. The ***heap*** which is also referred to as ***free store***, represents a large pool of unused memory allocated to your Java app. If your program keeps instantiating objects and leaving them on the heap, eventually it will run out of memory and crash. Luckily, garbage collection solves this problem.

### Understanding Garbage Collection
* garbage collection is a process of automatically freeing memory on the heap
	* by removing objects which are no longer reachable in the program
* these object is eligible for **gc**, Java can remove it from heap and free memory
* this process is out your control
	* you can suggest java to clean it but cannot force it
	* you cannot know if and when the memory will be freed

### Eligibility for Garbage Collection
* Object is eligible for **g.c.** once it is no longer reachable by the program
	1. the object has no reference pointing to it
	2. all references of the object have gone out of scope
- In other words when object "hangs in the air" 

```
public class gcExample {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String a, b;
		a = new String("Emperor");
		b = new String("Johnny");
		a = b;
		String c = a;
		a = null;
	}
}
```

## Remember!!!
#### G.C. collects objects NOT references
#### References live on the STACK
