'Java applications contain two types of data: primitive types and reference types. In this section, we discuss the differences between a primitive type and a reference type.

## Using primitive types

Java has eight built-in data types, referred to as the Java ***primitive types***. These eight data types represent the building blocks for Java Objects, because all java objects are just a complex collection of these primitive data types. A primitive is not an object in Java, nor does it represent an object. A primitive is just a single value in memory, such as a number or character.

### The primitive types

| **Keyword** | **Type**                             | **Min Value**  | **Max Value** | **Default value** | **Example** |
| :---------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| boolean     | true \| false                        | n/a            | n/a           | false             | true        |
| byte        | 8-bit integral value                 | -128           | 127           | 0                 | 123         |
| short       | 16-bit integral value                | -32,768        | 32,767        | 0                 | 123         |
| int         | 32-bit integral value                | -2,147,483,648 | 2,147,483,647 | 0                 | 123         |
| long        | 64-bit integral value                | $-2^{63}$      | $2^{63} - 1$  | 0L                | 123L        |
| float       | 32-bit floating-point integral value | n/a            | n/a           | 0.0f              | 123.45f     |
| double      | 64-bit floating-point integral value | n/a            | n/a           | 0.0               | 123.456     |
| char        | 16-bit Unicode value                 | 0              | 65,535        | \u0000            | 'a'         |

> **Is String a Primitive?**
>No is not, String is often mistaken for a ninth primitive because Java includes built in support for *String* literals and operators. ***String is an object, NOT a primitive***

Key points from this table:
- The **byte, short, int and long** types are used for integer values without decimal points
- Each numeric type uses twice as many bits as the smaller similar type. For example **short** uses twice as many bits as **byte** does.
- All of the numeric types are signed and reserve one of their bits to cover a negative range. For example, instead of a **byte** covering **0 to 255 (or even 1 to 256)**, it actually covers **-128 to 128**.
- A float requires the letter **f** or **F** following the number so Java knows it is a float. Without and f or F, Java interprets a decimal as a **double**.
- A long requires the letter **l** or **L** following the number so Java knows it is a long. Without an **l** or **L**, Java interprets a number without a decimal point as an **int** in most scenarios.

> **Signed and Unsigned: short and char**
> 	You should be aware that ***short*** and ***char*** are closely related, as both are stored as integral types with the same 16-bit length. The primary difference is that **short** is ***signed***, which means it splits its range across the positive and negative integers. Alternatively, ***char*** is unsigned, which means its range is strictly positive, including 0.

> 	Often, ***short*** and ***char*** values can be cast to one another because the underlying data size is the same.
