Are a feature introduced in Java 15 also known as multi-line strings.
Before text blocks you would have multi-line strings like this:
```
String eyeTest = "\"Java Study Guide\"\n    by Johnny";
```
This does work is hard to read.
Now let's see an example of text block:
```
String textBlock = """
	Java study guide
		by Johnny""";
```
A text block start and ends with three double quotes (`"""`) and the contents don't need to be escaped. This is so much easier to read.
After the first three double quotes `"""` you have to start a new line or you get a compilation error. The end ones are required to be on a new line, you can place them whenever you like.
