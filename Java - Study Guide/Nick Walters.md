Hi Nick,
Ask about promotion and the reality of getting it, the truth is I have asked for a promotion 3 times and got different feedback every time about not getting it. 

- Attach the files I have sent over last time for my promotion.
- Add the feedback.

Although every person in my team and the client agreed that I am ready and deserve it.

Also I wanted to ask if you have any feedback for me about how to properly word my promotion if you think I have a solid chance of getting promoted.

Thank you
